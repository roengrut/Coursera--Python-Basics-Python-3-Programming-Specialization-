# Syllabus

Welcome to Python Basics, taught by  Paul Resnick, Steve Oney, and Jaclyn Cohen!

This course introduces the basics of Python 3, including conditional execution and iteration as control structures, and strings and lists as data structures. You'll program an on-screen Turtle to draw pretty pictures. You'll also learn to draw reference diagrams as a way to reason about program executions, which will help to build up your debugging skills. The course has no prerequisites. It will cover Chapters 1-9 of the textbook "Fundamentals of Python Programming," which is the accompanying text (optional and free) for this course.

The course is for you if you're a newcomer to Python programming, if you need a refresher on Python basics, or if you may have had some exposure to Python programming but want a more in-depth exposition and vocabulary for describing and reasoning about programs.

## Participation Strategies

Engaged learning looks different for everybody. In this course, we hope you will define your own measures of success and engage with the material in a way that best suits your needs. We recognize and celebrate the diverse ways learners engage in courses. As you go through this course, we hope you will reflect on your unique skills, needs, and aspirations, and engage in the course material in a way that aligns with your own goals. While the course provides time estimates for completion, you should feel empowered to engage in the material in whatever ways make sense to you.

## Course Schedule & Grading Policy 

### Week One: 20%

In week one you will be introduced to programming in python through lectures and the Runestone textbook - an interactive online textbook built for this course. By the end of the module, you will have run your first python program, and learned how to draw images by writing a program.

    Assessment - Programming in Python (10%)

    Assessment - Turtle Graphics (10%)

### Week Two: 20%

In week two you will use the lectures and the Runestone textbook to understand the basics of a few python data types - lists, strings, tuples - as well as a control structure - for loops. By the end of this week, you will be able to write more complex programs that create drawings by incorporating for loops. Finally, we will present the basics of an accumulation pattern to you, which will be expanded on in each week for the rest of the course.

    Assessment - Lists and Strings (10%)

    Assignment - Week Two (10%)

### Week Three: 10%

In week three you will learn a new python data type - the boolean - as well as another control structure - conditional execution. Through the use of video lectures and the Runestone textbook, you will learn what Binary, Unary, Nested, and Chained Conditionals are, as well as how to incorporate conditionals within an accumulation pattern.

    Assessment - Week Three (10%)

### Week Four: 50%

In week four we will present deeper knowledge on using lists, strings, and python objects in general. We will also cover how to use the accumulation pattern with lists and with strings. The final assignment will test your knowledge and skills through application, much like previous assessments and assignments did, though with a more difficult set of tasks now that you have learned the basics.

    Assessment - Sequence Mutation (7.5%)

    Assessment - Methods: Lists and Strings (7.5%)

    Assessment - Accumulating Lists and Strings (7.5%)

    Assessment - Way of the Programmer Week Four (7.5%)

    Assignment - Final course assignment (20%)

## Ground Rules

We expect everyone to be mindful of what they say and its potential impact on others. The goal is to have respectful discussions that do not violate the community space created for these conversations. Here are some productive ways to engage in this course: 

    Participate: This is a community. Read what others have written and share your thoughts.

    Stay curious: Learn from experts and each other by listening and asking questions, not making assumptions.

    Keep your passion positive: When replying to a discussion forum post, respond with thoughts on what was said, not about the person who posted. Avoid using all caps, too many exclamation points, or aggressive language.

    Acknowledge discomfort: The topics discussed in this course might be challenging or hard to talk about. Stick with it and remember the benefits of having these tough conversations that surface from multiple perspectives.

We expect all learners to abide by our full Learner Engagement Policy. We will specifically be monitoring this course for language that could be considered inflammatory, incivil, racist, or otherwise unacceptable for this learning space, and we will remove language deemed such.

Please note that external study groups on applications like WhatsApp are not affiliated or endorsed by the University of Michigan. We strongly discourage joining external groups and instead recommend interacting with your fellow learners within the platform.

Please express caution if you do join or post any personal information in these forums or in these groups. These forums are publicly accessible and any information you post may be collected, published, or used in an exploitative manner (scams, etc).

## Academic Honesty

All submitted work should be your own and academic dishonesty is not allowed. Academic dishonesty can be defined as:

    Copying answers

    Copying words, ideas, or other materials from another source without giving credit to the original author

    Copying from your peers within the course

    Employing or allowing another person to alter or revise your work, and then submitting the work as your own

Please don’t share or reuse solutions to assignments which is an academic integrity concern. Please do not:

    Share complete assignment code in the course discussion forums

    Upload completed assignments to public websites with the goal of sharing solutions. (You can share your work and ideas for professional purposes though).

    Take a peer’s solution and submit it as your own

## Course Support

Questions and discussion of course material should take place within the course itself. Please do not contact instructors or teaching assistants off the platform, as responding to individual questions is virtually impossible. We encourage you to direct your questions to [forum], where your question might be answered by a fellow learner or one of our course team members. For technical help please contact the Coursera Learner Help Center or use the support forums.

## Accessibility 

We are committed to developing accessible learning experiences for the widest possible audience. We recognize that learners with disabilities (including but not limited to visual impairments, hearing impairments, cognitive disabilities, or motor disabilities) might need more specific accessibility-related support to achieve learning goals in this course. 

Please use the accessibility feedback form to let us know about any accessibility challenges such as urgent issues that keep you from making progress in the course (e.g., missing or inadequate alt-text, captioning errors).

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice

We welcome all learners to this course. People like you are joining from all over the world and we value this diversity. We strive to create a community of mutual respect and trust, where people from all backgrounds, identities and views are valued and heard without the threat of bias, harassment, intimidation, or discrimination. We pay attention to your feedback, how different types of learners experience this course, and aim to make improvements so the course can best serve everyone. We hope you enjoy learning about topics that are important to you.
